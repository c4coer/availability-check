# availability-check
Home Assistant blueprints are useful for creating automations to check the unavailability of Home Assistant entities with a specific label. If an entity becomes unavailable, a notification is sent with a list of unavailable entities.
These blueprints are currently only available in French.
- availability_check_label.yaml: Checks entities with a specific label.
- availability_check_wildcards.yaml: Checks entities whose ID matches a string filter with wildcards.
